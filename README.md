# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Number Generation using MNIST Dataset and PyTorch

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST dataset and PyTorch. The GAN is trained to generate realistic handwritten digit images.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9 or higher
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

  ## Dataset

This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed using torchvision.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are always welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request.
